    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Scotch eggs are soft-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage and bread crumbs, deep-fried for a delicious savory treat.</p>
    <p>They're a British pub favorite, perfect for family occasions or picnics.</p>
    <p>We like to make these on Christmas Eve served on a bed of lettuce with sliced tomatoes and mustard for garnish.</p>
     


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 quart oil for frying</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
